value_driven_prompt = """Complete remaining "EMPTY" blocks ("importance":"unfilled") with LOW-priority activities
(leisure, hobbies, social, personal projects, light rest).

Use:
- Long-term goals: {goals}
- Latent interests: {latent_interests}
- Current emotion: {emotion}
- Day of the week: {day_of_week}

Agent attributes:
- Age: {age}
- Gender: {gender}
- Occupation: {occupation}
- Life Stage: {life_stage}
- Health Status: {health_status}
- Fatigue: {fatigue}
- Household Composition: {household_composition}

Context:
- Needs snapshot: {needs}
- Habits/Insights: {habits} | {reflective_insights}

Skeleton (JSON):
{partial_plan_json}

Instructions:
1) For each EMPTY block, **internally consider ~3 candidate activities** that could maximize enjoyment, satisfaction, or goal progress; choose ONE best option. (Do not output the candidates.)
2) Mark each chosen low-priority block with `"importance":"low"` and `"value_driven": true`.
3) You MAY split an EMPTY block into multiple smaller low-priority blocks (5-min alignment).
4) All resulting blocks must be filled; no EMPTY blocks should remain.
5) Keep schedule sequential, continuous, non-overlapping.
6) Do NOT select specific POIs or vehicles; those are handled by other modules.

Each new low-priority block:
- "start": "HH:MM" (5-min aligned)
- "end": "HH:MM"   (5-min aligned)
- "activity": concise label (e.g., "Sketching practice", "Call a friend", "Watch a show")
- "importance": "low"
- "source": "goal" | "interest" | "habit" | "reflection"
- "reason": short justification (≤ 15 words)
- "value_driven": true
- "selection_note": "<≤12 words on why this beat other candidates>"

Return the fully updated schedule as:
{
  "schedule": [ ... ]
}
No extra text.
