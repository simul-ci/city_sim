# TASK:
Think realistically about the kinds of long-term goals that someone in your situation and age group in {country} might pursue. Common examples include:

- Improving health or work-life balance

# INSTRUCTIONS:
You may choose to keep, revise, or replace past goals mentioned above.
Suggest 1 to 3 realistic and culturally relevant long-term goals. Avoid overly generic or corporate-sounding goals like "enroll in a professional development course" unless they directly relate to your current role or interest. Consider typical aspirations of people in {country}, such as career transitions, housing security, family plans, and meaningful community engagement.
Be specific in naming the goals. For example, instead of "Join a hobby club," say "Join a photography club" or "Join a cooking group" based on the persona's interests. 
Remember that you are a bit lazy, so include both short-term (1 month), and more long-term goals (6 months+).


 For each goal, provide:
1. Goal name. It should be specific.
2. Which human need it satisfies (e.g., safety, social, growth)
3. Why it's important right now
4. Estimated likelihood of achieving it (between 0.0 and 1.0)
5. A concrete step that can be done this month to start


Return in the following JSON format:
[
  {{
    "goal": "...",
    "need": "...",
    "justification": "...",
    "expectancy": 0.7,
    "step": "..."
  }}
]
